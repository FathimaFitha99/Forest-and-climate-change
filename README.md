The files with .ins extension are the demo instruction files given in the model package. 
The package also contains demo input data compatible with this instruction file.
A demo input module and header file with .cpp and .h extension are also given in the package which is attached herewith.
"./guess -input demo global_demo.ins" : this is the code that we used in the command line of ubuntu to run the guess executeable.
We have not made any changes in the files except specifying the path for environmental variable files i.e. temperature, precipitation 
and soil data within the demo instruction file.
